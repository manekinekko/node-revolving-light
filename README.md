Revolving lights with Node.js
==

A simple project demoing how to control a set of revolving lights with node.js and arduino.

Usage
==

1) First of all, you will need to install the Advanced Firmata firmware (inside the arduino folder) on you board (for me, it was the makeymakey board). Use the Arduino IDE to upload the firmware to the board.

2) Next, upload the revolving-lights.ino sktch to your board, again using the Arduino IDE.

3) Run the node-server.js with node.

4) Time to hack around ^^
